## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **General**

**Q: Is this the official Kick app?**
A: No, Twick is a third-party client built to provide a lightweight, native chat experience for iOS users. We are not affiliated with Kick.com.

**Q: Why isn't the chat loading?**
A: Please check your internet connection first. Occasionally, Kick's WebSocket servers may be under heavy load. Try switching to a different channel and back to reconnect.

### **Features & Customization**

**Q: Does this app support 7TV emotes?**
A: Yes! We automatically load 7TV emotes for the channel you are viewing. If they aren't appearing, please ensure you have the latest version of the app installed.

**Q: How do I delete a channel from my list?**
A: You can remove a channel by long-pressing the channel name in the bottom dock and selecting "Remove," or by swiping left on the channel name in the Channel Manager list.

### **Pro & Purchases**

**Q: I bought Pro, but the app still shows ads/limits.**
A: Go to **Settings > Upgrade to Pro** and tap the **"Restore Purchases"** button at the bottom. This will re-sync your receipt with the App Store.

**Q: What does the Pro upgrade include?**
A: The Pro upgrade removes all ads, allows you to add unlimited channels (free users are limited to 2), and unlocks timestamps for messages. It is a one-time purchase.
