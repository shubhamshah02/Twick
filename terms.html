                <p>This site and the mobile applications and services available in connection with this site and mobile application (the “App”) are made available to you by Shubham Shah (“We”) subject to these Terms of Service, including those set forth in the Privacy Policy (the “Terms”).

                <h3>Third-Party Platform Dependency</h3>
                <p>Twick is a third-party client that interacts with public APIs provided by Twitch Interactive, Inc., Kick Streaming Pty Ltd, and various emote providers (7TV, BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ). We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for these platforms. <strong>We are not responsible for any outages, API changes, server downtime, or account restrictions (bans/suspensions) occurring on these third-party platforms that may render the App non-functional.</strong> The App is provided "as is" and relies on the continued availability of these third-party services.</p>

                <p>If you choose to buy a subscription to the App (Twick Pro), payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.</p>
                <p>All purchases are final. We cannot issue refunds for purchases charged to your Apple ID.</p>

You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer or sell for any commercial purposes any portion of the App, use of the App or access to the App.</p>
