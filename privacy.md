### A. Personal Data
We **do not** require you to create an account with us to use the application. We do not store your name, email address, or phone number on our servers.

### B. Chat & Usage Data
The app connects directly to Kick.com's public chat servers.
- **Chat History:** Chat history is fetched from Kick's public API. We do not store chat logs on our own servers.
- **Local Settings:** Your preferences (e.g., saved channels, timestamp settings) are stored locally on your device using Apple's encrypted storage.

## 2. In-App Purchases
All financial transactions for the "Pro" upgrade are handled directly through **Apple's App Store**.
- We do not process, store, or have access to your credit card information.

Our app interacts with the following third-party services to function:
- **Kick.com:** To retrieve chat messages and user info.
- **7TV:** To retrieve third-party emotes.
- **Google AdMob:** To display advertisements (Free version only).

These services have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to review them.
